Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element1 element2 =>(select all element2 within element1)
element1 > element2 =>(select element2 with only parent element1)
element1 + element2 =>(select element2 that's exactly after element1)
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order

Misc. notes:
css float should be used on images, float also grabs everything else and puts it in other dorection
clear: both should help and reposition other elements (for example, footer )
